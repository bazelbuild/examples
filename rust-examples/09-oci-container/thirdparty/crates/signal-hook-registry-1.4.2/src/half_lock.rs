//! The half-lock structure
//!
//! We need a way to protect the structure with configured hooks â€’ a signal may happen in arbitrary
//! thread and needs to read them while another thread might be manipulating the structure.
//!
//! Under ordinary circumstances we would be happy to just use `Mutex<HashMap<c_int, _>>`. However,
//! as we use it in the signal handler, we are severely limited in what we can or can't use. So we
//! choose to implement kind of spin-look thing with atomics.
//!
//! In the reader it is always simply locked and then unlocked, making sure it doesn't disappear
//! while in use.
//!
//! The writer has a separate mutex (that prevents other writers; this is used outside of the
//! signal handler), makes a copy of the data and swaps an atomic pointer to the data structure.
//! But it waits until everything is unlocked (no signal handler has the old data) for dropping the
//! old instance. There's a generation trick to make sure that new signal locks another instance.
//!
//! The downside is, this is an active spin lock at the writer end. However, we assume than:
//!
//! * Signals are one time setup before we actually have threads. We just need to make *sure* we
//!   are safe even if this is not true.
//! * Signals are rare, happening at the same time as the write even rarer.
//! * Signals are short, as there is mostly nothing allowed inside them anyway.
//! * Our tool box is severely limited.
//!
//! Therefore this is hopefully reasonable trade-off.
//!
//! # Atomic orderings
//!
//! The whole code uses SeqCst conservatively. Atomics are not used because of performance here and
//! are the minor price around signals anyway. But the comments state which orderings should be
//! enough in practice in case someone wants to get inspired (but do make your own check through
//! them anyway).
