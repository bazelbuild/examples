# Migration

## 0.4, 0.5 âž¡ 0.6

Architecturally 0.6 is much different from the previous versions. If you didn't implement your own scheduler, this version's only big change is the adding a reference of the scheduler when creating/removing notifications of a job.

### Removals

#### JobScheduler::new_with_scheduler()
The JobSchedulerWithoutSync trait has been removed. The new_with_scheduler method accordingly also. Replaced with new_with_storage_and_code().

#### JobStore
JobStore trait has been removed. Replaced by MetadataStore and NotificationStore traits.

#### JobSchedulerWithoutSync
No longer used.

#### SimpleJobScheduler
JobSchedulerWithoutSync trait deletion and default implementation SimpleJobScheduler removed.

#### SimpleJobStore
Removed as JobStore trait has been removed.

### API changes
#### Add &scheduler to notification add / removal

The first parameter to all of these functions on the JobLocked type needs to pass a reference to the scheduler as a first parameter.

Affected methods:
