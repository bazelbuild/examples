#      $ANDROID_SDK_BUILD_TOOLS_VERSION are respectively the
#      path to the Android SDK, the API Level of the SDK and
#      the version of the build tools. If the path isn't defined
#      the android build won't be tested. The 2 other one are defaulted
#      to, respectively, "22" and "22.0.1".
