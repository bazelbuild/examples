# Macros

This workspace demonstrates the features of
[Symbolic Macros](https://bazel.build/extending/macros), new to Bazel 8.0.

It's recommended to start by reading the `//main` package's BUILD file, then
`//word_counter`, `//fancy_word_counter`, and `//letter_metrics`. Each builds
on the features of the previous, and the `//main` package ties them all
together.
