# A rule that takes in a series of "declarations" and produces "compiled
# output" for some of those declarations, along with a manifest. Here, the
# declarations are simply words in a dictionary text file, and the compiled
# output of a word is just its hash.
#
# The compiled outputs are specified by the user, while the manifest file is
# created automatically. Both kinds of outputs are predeclared, and can be
# referred to in the target graph or built in the command line, e.g.:
#
#     bazel build //predeclared_outputs:dog.md5
#
# If you do not need to refer to the output files as labels, it may be simpler
# to pass in the words as an attr.string_list, and declare the files in the
# implementation function instead.
#
# This rule assumes the presence of shell commands "grep", "md5sum", and "cut".
